		   Default modules.
		   Third party Modules.
		   
		   application -> [Default modules, third party modules/libraries, 
		                  tools/utilies]
						  
						  
		  Globally Downloading the tools/utilities/libraries
		  
		     Advantages:
			          Within that particular system all projects 
                      can use them and call them
            Disadvantage:
                     Portability - [when you want to pack and take the application 
                     to other system, unless we explore the code we never know 
                     what libraries are needed/used]


        Virtual Environment

         In python , Virtual Environment is  a solution for project and Dependency management
         , we can create a seperate isolated environment for your app/project alone so that 
         the library dependencies needed for that project will be maintained in that environment
         itself
